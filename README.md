# Data-Modeling-with-Cassandra
I modeled the my data by cretating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. 
I provided a part of the ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.
Thorough detail is the Python notebook. 

Thanks
